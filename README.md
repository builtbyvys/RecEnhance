# RecEnhance.. what is it?
RecEnhance is a cross-platform application that enhances the experience of the [Rec Room website](https://rec.net). 
It plans to bring needed features that are either not planned or not implemented on the website itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **This is currently not functional, as I have yet to build the blocks to have this be put out in production.
> You can think of this as a roadmap for what to expect.**

# Features
- Efficiently manage different social aspects of your profile
- Get relative and accurate information for specific rounded fields (join date, offline since, etc.)
- An API that can be used to create your own interfaces or spin-offs
- Cross-platform notifications
- *And more to come soon!*

# How is this possible!?
I'd like to give a huge thanks to the [Unofficial RecNet API](https://www.postman.com/jordanparki7/workspace/recnet-api/collection/12396983-e89f066d-2ef6-4381-85a4-73bef291cbe1), 
which has inspired me (maybe a few other people) to work on this.

# Why are you doing this?
I was recently trying to clean up [my own profile](https://rec.net/user/vyslix) *(please subscribe)*, and I noticed that it would've been extremely slow to do this 
manually. So, I took it upon myself to look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/builtbyvys/RecEnhance/edit/main/README.md#how-is-this-possible) 
and make a couple of small snippets to make the process **a LOT faster**. As I was doing so, I started to think if it was viable to perhaps make 
it an entire project for the community. I decided to take the initative and ask if people were interested. As I expected, many people were confused.
I probably would be too if I joined the discord and just spat out an entire paragraph about a project. Regardless, I continued on and began on a
roadmap. We are now here.

# Project Maintenance
To be quite frank, my roadmap has been telling me that I will have to allocate some of my money to make
the API freely accessible. I will also be paying for the domain expenses, to of course provide a landing
page and advertise this "amazing" FOSS application. It is up to you to decide if you want to call it amazing. 
I am a high school student, currently aiming for the goal of being an electrical engineer one day. As so, I am
allocating the time out of my day to make this repository a reality. I would highly appreciate any donations
to this project, regardless of the amount. Any donation motivates me to keep going and working on this!
